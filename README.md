# Foobar

A few weeks ago (as of today), I had the chance to receive an invitation to pass the Google Foobar Challenges.  
If you know nothing about the Foobar challenge, here's [an article](https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f) on it that I found on the internet.  
Basically, Foobar is a "secret" hiring challenge from Google. From what I understood, they make a selection based on your search history (maybe more). 
There's probably an algorithm floating around somewhere that sends you an invitation if it judges that you fit its conditions, although I heard it was quite hard to trigger voluntarily.  
  
## How it is like

To describe it, when you accept the invitation, you're sent to another page that looks like a terminal  where you can request challenges.  
Challenges are some kind of programming questions you have to answer in Python or Java in a limited amount of time.  
There are nine challenges to complete distributed in five difficulty levels :  
  
 - **One level 1 challenge** *(48h)** : that one was some kind of interview-level question. For me it was simple string manipulation exercice. I had almost never touched Python before and was able to complete it in like an hour.
 - **Two level 2 challenges** *(72h)** : here you start to see some data structures appearing. I had to manipulate a perfect binary tree for my first question. Second one felt like attributing an id to a location (more on that in the level 2 readme).
 - **Three level 3 challenges** *(192h)** : things started to get more technical here. I had to use some well known algorithms to complete some of those. For example the first one used Breadth First Search to find a path in a grid.
 - **Two level 4 challenges** *(360h)** : to me this would probably the "hardest" part. To complete those I had to make a lot of research because I didn't know any of the two problems I had. First was Graph Theory with the maximum flow problem, second was a complex geometry problem taht took me around ten days to solve (more on this in the level 4 readme).
 - **One level 5 challenge** *(528h)** : to be honest, this one may be harder than the level 4s, but it is in fact purely mathematical so I didn't take the time to really try and solve it yet. I think I know what to use (mathematical permutations/combinatorics) but lack the time to do it now, maybe I'll try even after the deadline.
 
**: not sure about the exact time since it was a few weeks ago for some of those but this should be close enough.*
