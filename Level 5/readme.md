## The last challenge
To my surprise, this is pure maths.  
You are given 3 parameters, a matrix width and height, and a number of states. 
You are also told that order of columns and rows does not matter. 
You must wreite a function that figures out how many different configurations you can have using those.  
  
From what I understood I think this is about Mathematical Permutaions/Combinatorics, and the use of Polya's Counting Theorem and Burnside's Lemma. 
I have a few idea that I tried already quickly, but I lack the time right now to really try hard to solve this. 
I found multiple [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0d9bYZ_qDY) online that could help. 
I think the basic idea is figuring out all the different symetries and counting them, then "just" apply the formula. 
But I didn't manage to do so yet, there must be more to it.  

I'll try to find some time to solve this if I'm even able to, and if I can maybe I'll try it out later to at least be able to say I did it.
