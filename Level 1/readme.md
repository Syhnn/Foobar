# Level 1
## First and only challenge
This was an easy first exercise. The idea was to manipulate a string to "decrypt" it using a very simple method : swap every lowercase character for its "opposite".  
So for instance : 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y' and so on.  
  
It took me about an hour to start learning Python and do the exercise. I had already used Python once before so I had an idea of what to expect. Apart from that there isn't much more to explain here.  

## Bonus level
This isn't really part of the Foobar challenge. But when you clear level 2 and level 4 you get a refer-a-friend link both times that you can send someone else so they can try Foobar. This is an exercise one of them sent me that I resolved for fun, but since it isn't part of my challenge I'll probably end up removing it.
